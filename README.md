# Error handling in Shell Scripting

## Summary of Error Handling in Shell Scripting

Error handling in shell scripting is essential for creating reliable and user-friendly scripts by anticipating and managing potential issues during execution. Key strategies include identifying possible errors such as invalid user input, command failures, or unavailable resources, and using conditional statements to respond appropriately based on command exit statuses. Providing clear and informative error messages enhances usability. A practical example is checking if an AWS S3 bucket already exists before creating it to prevent failure due to duplication. By incorporating checks using commands like aws s3api head-bucket, scripts can avoid redundant operations and handle errors gracefully, improving overall script robustness.
